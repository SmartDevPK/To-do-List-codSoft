# Voting App 

---------------------
Live website: https://poll-zle.herokuapp.com/
---------------------

## Overview
This is a voting app that was built upon [Clementine.js boilerplate](http://www.clementinejs.com/). Clementine.js is a lightweight boilerplate for fullstack JavaScript development which utilizes MongoDB, Express and Node.js. It also includes GitHub authentication using [Passport](http://passportjs.org/). For simplication purposes, only client's Github account is used as an account of this page.


## User stories:
* As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
* As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
* As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
* As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
* As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
* As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
* As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
* As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
